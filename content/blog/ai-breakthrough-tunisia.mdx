## Unprecedented Results in Water Conservation

Our latest Edge AI algorithms have achieved remarkable results in the Tunisia pilot site, demonstrating the power of intelligent irrigation management. The system has successfully reduced water consumption by 45% while maintaining optimal crop yields.

## How It Works

The OSIRRIS system combines multiple data sources:

- Real-time soil moisture sensors
- Weather pattern analysis
- Crop growth stage monitoring
- Historical irrigation data

By processing this data through our Edge AI algorithms, the system can make precise irrigation decisions that optimize water usage without compromising crop health.

## Impact on Sustainability

This breakthrough represents a significant step forward in sustainable agriculture. With water scarcity becoming an increasingly critical issue in Mediterranean regions, technologies like OSIRRIS offer practical solutions for farmers.

## Next Steps

We're now expanding this pilot to additional sites across the Mediterranean region, with plans to integrate even more advanced predictive capabilities in the coming months.
