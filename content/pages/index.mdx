  subheading: Precision Soil Moisture Monitoring
  description: >-
    OSIRRIS develops a precision irrigation system with semi-autonomous
    operation,  featuring automatic calibration and soil evaluation. Our smart
    tensiometers measure  tension and calculate soil water content, plant
    stress, and local recommendations  with unprecedented accuracy. The system
    combines advanced IoT sensors with machine  learning algorithms to deliver
    intelligent irrigation management.
