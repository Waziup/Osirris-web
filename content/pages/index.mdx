  description: >-
    The Osirris project, funded by the TUNGER 2+2 research and innovation
    program, is a 3-year initiative involving Germany and

    Tunisia, focusing on creating an advanced irrigation platform. This platform
    integrates Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Edge
    computing to enhance water management for agriculture, particularly in
    challenging environments.
  objectives:
    - 'Create a Smart Tensiometer for measuring soil and plant water stress,'
    - 'Create a Edge-capable AI model for autonomous irrigation,'
    - 'Implement an AI-enabled IoT gateway for controlling the irrigation,'
    - Pilot the OSIRRIS platform in several Tunisia farms.

    OSIRRIS develops a precision irrigation system with semi-autonomous
    operation,  featuring automatic calibration and soil evaluation. Our smart
    tensiometers measure  tension and calculate soil water content, plant
    stress, and local recommendations  with unprecedented accuracy. The system
    combines advanced IoT sensors with machine  learning algorithms to deliver
    intelligent irrigation management.

      description: >-
        Our local Machine Learning models are continuouly re-trained on measured
        tension values and many other environmental parameters. The system
        learns from context data and continuously improves irrigation
        recommendations.
