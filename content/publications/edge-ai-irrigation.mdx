## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to precision irrigation using Edge AI technology deployed in Mediterranean agricultural settings. Our system combines real-time soil moisture monitoring with weather prediction and crop growth models to optimize irrigation schedules.

## Key Findings

- 45% reduction in water consumption
- Maintained or improved crop yields
- 99.2% system uptime in field conditions
- Scalable architecture suitable for various farm sizes

## Methodology

The OSIRRIS system employs a distributed network of smart tensiometers connected via LoRaWAN, with Edge AI processing enabling real-time decision-making without reliance on cloud connectivity.

## Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that Edge AI-driven irrigation management can significantly reduce water consumption while maintaining agricultural productivity, offering a practical solution for sustainable farming in water-scarce regions.
