### 1. INTRODUCTION

Tunisia is a semi-arid to arid country over three-quarters of its territory, with rainfall amounts varying between 1500 mm in the northern regions to less than 100 mm in the south. The total hydraulic resources are estimated at 4.875 billion m³/year, which is divided into surface water (2.7 billion m³/year) and groundwater (2.175 billion m³/year); the northern basins provide 82% of the surface water, while 29% of the groundwater resources come from deep non-renewable fossil aquifers in the South.
